## Usage Instructions
 
 * Download CMPDL on the [Releases](https://github.com/Vazkii/CMPDL/releases) page. Run it.
 * Find the pack you want. We'll use [Proton](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/proton) as an example.
 * Copy the URL of the project home on CurseForge. It should look like the one on the last point. Paste this URL on the "Modpack URL" field on CMPDL. (you can also choose a local modpack file)
 * To specify a version of the modpack, enter that version in the "Curse File ID" field
 * Press Download and wait.
 * Copy your modpack files over to wherever you want them.
